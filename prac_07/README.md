## Introduction

This repository contains practicals from Programming II. I am Eric Roy, a student enrolled in JCU.

## Lessons:

- **Consistent Naming:** One of the key lessons learned is the importance of consistent variable/function naming.

- **Functions:** Breaking down code into smaller functions makes the code easier to understand.

- **Error Handling:** Implementing error handling is crucial for writing good code.
